                <h1>HISTORY OF SAINT SOPHIE UKRAINIAN ORTHODOX PARISH OF
                    MONTREAL</h1>
                <p>An account of the history of our parish guides us on a journey into the past, to see the
                    road travelled by our predecessors. The paths they walked were indeed long and often
                    thorny. They managed to secure the development they foresaw, in faith, at the founding
                    of our Saint Sophie Parish!</p>
                <p>It is worth noting that the magnificent and ancient Cathedral of Holy Wisdom (“Sophia”
                    in Greek) in Kyiv was the inspiration for our building our Church community here in
                    Canada. It embodied stability and longevity, linking us to the time-honoured faith and
                    traditions of our motherland, towards its Church.</p>
                <p>On March 9, 1925, a group of dedicated believers and patriots founded the Saint Sophie
                    Ukrainian Orthodox Brotherhood with the purpose of organizing a Ukrainian Orthodox
                    Christian community in Montreal.</p>
                <p>The Reverend Fr. Volodymyr Sluzar, a young and energetic priest from Bukovyna in
                    Ukraine, along with his wife Leonia, both, arrived in Montreal one year later (in 1926).
                    The couple launched the first Ukrainian Orthodox Parish in Montreal. Initially our
                    community rented a church building for public worship from a local Syrian community.
                    Later on (in 1929) having a desire to become church building owners, our community
                    purchased a Baptist Church on Delorimier Street.</p>
                <p>The arrival of the post-World War II wave of immigrants sharply raised the number of
                    believers. The old church premises became unsuitable to accommodate the numerous
                    worshipers, so the community decided to build a new church.</p>
                <p>Thanks to the enormous spiritual efforts of Protopresbyter Volodymyr Sluzar, our
                    community purchased a plot of land for construction of a new Temple in 1953. The
                    construction commenced in 1960 and lasted two years.</p>
                <p>Тhe project was finished in 1962, and the new Church, named in honour of SOPHIA, the
                    Wisdom of God, was consecrated by Metropolitan Ilarion Ohienko. The parish proclaims
                    the Christian faith from that time to the present.</p>
                <p>The first Rector, Fr. Protopresbyter Volodymyr Sluzar dedicated himself to ministry at
                    the Saint Sophie parish for forty-eight years. Inasmuch as the number of
                    parishioners was considerable at that time, he was assisted by Archpriest Fr. Dr. Ivan
                    Stus, Archpriest Fr. Fedir Leheniuk, and Archpriest Fr. Stephen Symchych.</p>
                <p>When it became difficult for Fr. Volodymyr Sluzar to continue celebrating Services, his
                    assistant, Archpriest Fr. Ihor Kutash, a young and energetic priest, took over and
                    dedicated himself to parish service for more than 30 years.</p>
                <p>In 1999, when Fr. Ihor decided to dedicate himself to academic activities, he was
                    succeeded by Archpriest Fr. Kouchnir, also from Bukovyna, who had been the Rector of
                    Saint Michael Parish in Edmonton. Irena Gerych, Chair of the Church Council,
                    arranged the relocation of the new Rector to Montreal</p>
                <p>During the 17-year pastoral service of Fr. Volodymyr the congregation realized two
                    major projects and marked a memorable event.</p>
                <p><strong>Project 1:</strong> At the initiative of Victor Sidorenko, Chair of the Church Council, the
                    iconography of the entire church interior was completed (the front part had been done
                    earlier). Thanks to his conscientious efforts, the Cathedral iconography
                    was fully completed using innovative technology.</p>
                <p><strong>Project 2:</strong> Construction of a chapel at Camp Saint Sophie. Serving as Director of Camp
                    St. Sophie, Fr. Volodymyr undertook the building of a chapel at the site. The Right Rev.
                    Yurij, formerly Bishop of the Eastern Eparchy (now Metropolitan Yurij, Primate of our
                    Church) laid the cornerstone for the chapel in 2010. Present at theofficial stone-laying
                    ceremony, besides Fr, Volodymyr, were Archpriest Fr. Ihor Kutash, Nicholai Michailuk
                    Sr., Nick Michailuk Jr., Adrianna Zerebecky and Victor Sidorenko, of blessed memory.</p>
                <p>God has blessed these good intentions in the construction of the chapel. The project
                    was completed in 2013 and in July of that same year, the chapel was consecrated in the
                    name of Equal-to-the-Apostles Great Kniaz’ St. Volodymyr, and Blessed
                    Knyahynia Olga, by Metropolitan Yurij together with Right Rev. Andriy, Bishop of the
                    Eastern Eparchy. The Chair of the Church Council at that time was
                    Yoris Gella, who fostered and promoted this project. At the same time a bell tower was
                    constructed in memory of parishioners, Illia and Raisa Temertey, parents of
                    ConstantineTemertey.</p>
                <p>The list of major and generous sponsors for this project includes
                    Mr. Constantine Tymertey, the Verdun Community "Prosvita", and the Saint
                    Sophie Camp Committee, especially, Adrianna Zerebecky and Nick Michailuk who
                    worked diligently from the onset until the completion of the project and assisted in its
                    successful realization. Itshould be noted that Camp Saint Sophie is part of the Eastern
                    Eparchy, and so received donations from it as well as from parishioners and friends of the
                    Cathedral to assist in its construction.</p>
                <p><strong>Memorable Event:</strong> - The extraordinarily joyful and festive celebration of the 90th
                    anniversary of our parish (October 1-2, 2016).</p>
                <p>The first day, October 1, Saturday, began with a seminar conducted by the
                    clergy (Archpriest Fr. Dr. Ihor Kutash, Fr. Ihor Okhrimchuk, and Archpriest Fr.
                    Volodymyr Kouchnir) for the youth of our parish and of St. Demetrius Parish in Toronto
                    under the leadership of Natalka Kovalenko and Khrystyna Kovalenko.</p>
                <p>The seminar was followed by Vespers, which was celebrated by his Grace, Andriy,
                    Bishop of the Eastern Eparchy. The service was attended by a great number offaithful
                    including former parishioners, who traveled from Edmonton, Vancouver, Ottawa,
                    London, and Toronto and Quebec City to be with us for this celebration.</p>
                <p>After Vespers, our generous and hospitable parishioners invited everyone for
                    a delicious dinner prepared by “The Daughters of Ukraine” women’s auxiliary.
                    Theatmosphere was wonderful and extremely friendly. Hearts were filled with joy and a
                    sincere wish to share memories of the past.</p>
                <p>Sunday, October 2, commenced with a solemn liturgy led by Bishop Andriy and
                    the participation of the local clergy: Archpriest Fr. Ihor Kutash of St. Mary the
                    Protectress, Parish in Montreal, Quebec; Fr. Ihor Okhrimtchouk of the Assumption of the 
                    blessed Virgin Parish in Ottawa, Ontario; and Archpriest Fr. Gene Ruditch, of the St.
                    George Parish in Lachine, Quebec. The Cathedral was filled with devoted faithful.</p>
                <p>After Liturgy, a glorious banquet was held at Auberge Universel located on Sherbrooke
                    Street. More than 300 guests attended this milestone event, including many guests from
                    out of town. Hramota Awards were presented to a number of parishioners and
                    scholarships also were awarded to five of our parishioners. To culminate the event, a
                    wonderful concert was offered by members and former members of our parish.</p>
                <p>The Anniversary Committee was composed of Archpriest Fr. Volodymyr, Maria
                    Kachmar-Buciora, Alexandra Kindrat, Eugenia Kindrat (Chair of the Committee), Yoris
                    Gella, Iryna Gerych, Vasyl Grosko, Olga Kowcz, Gregory Kowryha, Halyna Pylypchyk,
                    Dan Stechysin and Adrianna Zerebecky.</p>
                <p>As we go forward, we are entering a new one-hundred-year stage of our life, relying on
                    the same inflexible faith which inspired our founders and led them to great heroic
                    deeds. We, being their successors, continue with their efforts for the good
                    of our Christian Church and our parish.</p>
                <p>In our Parish, the Sunday school and Metropolitan Ilarion Ukrainian School
                    teach our children the Ukrainian language and religion. “The Daughters of
                    Ukraine” Women’sAuxiliary founded by Mrs. Leonia Sluzar, has celebrated its 90th
                    anniversary together with the entire community. Camp St. Sophie is also working hard
                    and supporting the parish financially organizing camp for our youth. The
                    Brotherhood Misericordia Christian arranges visits to shut-in parishioners at home, in
                    hospitals and in senior residences. We also offer memorial services to pray for
                    and preserve the memory of parishioners which have departed into eternal rest. Our
                    church choir is an integral part of our Cathedral and continues to work to bring glorious
                    music to our Liturgies; as do our altar servers who work diligently during services.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the fact that growth of parish life in the XXI century is getting
                    more challenging due to the greater concentration of people on material, rather
                    thanspiritual values, our Church as a religious institution seeks to observe the principles
                    of evangelical doctrine and overcome all obstacles and challenges. Eugenia Kindrat now
                    holds the position of Council Chair. She works faithfully to promote the development of
                    our parish.</p>
                <p>In closing, let me tell you a short story about a tree. One day a grandchild playing in the
                    backyard noticed that his 80 year-old Grandpa was planting an apple tree and asked
                    him:“Grandpa, do you expect to pick and eat applies from this tree?” Grandpa, leaning on
                    the handle of his spade, answered gently:
                    “Surely not. I know that I will never eat apples from this tree. However, all my life
                    I have enjoyed apples from apple trees which I never planted. By planting this tree I am
                    trying to return kindness to those people who planted apple trees for me. This apple tree
                    will remain after me, and others will eat its fruit.”</p>
                <p>...Each of us, within the fold of the Church and acting through observance of his/her
                    Christian values and personal contributions to our parish life, is planting a tree which will
                    remain long after we have gone, as a sign of gratitude for those who built such a beautiful
                    Cathedral.</p>
                <p>The fourth and latest wave of immigrants who arrive in Canada, is gradually becoming
                    more and more closely involved into parish life. The Church reminds us that we are
                    all children of God and that Our Lord has a desire to see us in His Heavenly Home. As a
                    Ukrainian song says, ‘Each of us enters this world to leave a trace…’</p>
